create a website named village to venture which solves the problem that Many rural women in India still lack access to essential resources and opportunities due to
the absence of a user-friendly digital platform that connects them to information, support,
and services..
Proposed Solution:
Rural and semi-urban women often face a lack of access to digital tools, career guidance,
and mental health resources due to language barriers, low digital literacy, and limited
localized support. Our website addresses this gap by offering following services :
● Provide information on government schemes, healthcare, education, and financial
literacy.
● Use regional languages to assist low-literacy users.
● Include peer-support forums, mentorship opportunities, and real-time service
recommendations.
● Be optimized for low bandwidth and offline functionality.
This solution aims to bridge the digital divide, empower women, and create long-term
socio-economic impact.
