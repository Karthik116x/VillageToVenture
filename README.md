🌾 Village to Venture
Empowering Rural Women Through Accessible Digital Solutions

Village to Venture is a purpose-driven digital platform designed to bridge the gap between rural and semi-urban women in India and the essential resources they need for personal and professional development. Despite the rise of technology, many women still lack access to information, support, and services due to language barriers, low digital literacy, and limited localized infrastructure.
